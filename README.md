source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

Important Note

This repository does not aim to harm or label any framework as good or bad. The benchmarks are conducted solely for performance evaluation and comparison purposes. The choice of a framework should be based on your specific project requirements and preferences. Huge respect to the minds behind all these awesome projects!
